# List of Changes

1) Bind the callback method functions to the Stopwatch class instance so that the callbacks will work.

2) Move the key index outside of the lap functional component and into to the list of the Stopwatch class instance.

3) Remove the forceUpdate and move the laps array property to the state so that deleting a lap will trigger an update when in the stopped state.

4) Add missing styles; add basic styles; add correctly named html elements for the laps list (ul and li).

5) Remove the settimeoout handle when the Stopwatch Class Component unmounts to prevent memory leak.
 
6) Add type definitions to the following: the delete callback function (return a void); the stopwatch class state; correctly define the lap function component type definitions; add return types to each method of the stopwatch class; add typecheck to the setTimeout handle property.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
